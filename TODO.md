# TODO

Decided, not built yet: each item is done in the change that first needs it (AGENTS.md,
section 0).

## Secrets — with the first real secret (the model provider's API key, roadmap step 4)

Secrets never go into `appsettings*.json`: those files are committed. Nothing copies or
generates secret files into the repo — the app reads them where they live.

| Where | Where the app gets a secret |
| --- | --- |
| laptop, `just server` | `dotnet user-secrets` — `~/.microsoft/usersecrets/<UserSecretsId>/secrets.json`, outside the repo; ASP.NET loads it in Development on top of appsettings. Set with `dotnet user-secrets set "Model:ApiKey" "…" --project AgentEval.Server` |
| laptop, `just up` | the same file: `compose.yaml` mounts `~/.microsoft/usersecrets` read-only into the server container (as Visual Studio's Docker tooling does) and the server loads user secrets there too |
| cluster | environment variables from a Kubernetes Secret (`Model__ApiKey`), created by the platform repo's `setup.sh`, read by the chart through `envFrom` |
| CI | none — the gate never calls a model |

To do in that change:

- [ ] `<UserSecretsId>` in `AgentEval.Server.csproj` (`dotnet user-secrets init`).
- [ ] The options class of the feature that needs the secret, bound from configuration,
      validated with `ValidateOnStart` — no default value for the secret.
- [ ] `compose.yaml`: mount `~/.microsoft/usersecrets` read-only; load user secrets in the
      container (`AddUserSecrets<Program>(optional: true)` outside Development, or run the
      container with `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development`) — pick one and say why.
- [ ] `scripts/.internal/secrets.sh`: back up and restore that one `secrets.json` to Bitwarden
      (folder Homelab, note `agenteval/user-secrets`) instead of `.env` files; `restore`
      writes it with mode 600 and keeps a differing file unless `--force`.
- [ ] Chart: the Secret's name as a value, `envFrom` on the server; the prompt in the
      platform repo's `setup.sh`; tell the owner to run it and `just secrets backup` there.
- [ ] AGENTS.md, section 7: replace the `.env` description with the above.
